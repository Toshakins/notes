# PRINCE2

PRINCE2 is a methodology for managing projects. It is a practical guide and it is not a theoretical book.

## Seven core principles

1. Continued Business Justification i.e. why we are doing this project?
2. Learn from experience
3. Defined roles and responsibilities
4. Manage by stages a.k.a split problem in steps
5. Manage by exception a.k.a bringing issues to the higher level of management only if they their cost exceeds planned
or expected. The purpose is to bother management with the most important variances from the planned direction or 
**results** of the business.
6. Focus on products. If it is not clear what product is, then focus on the results.
7. Tailor to suit the project environment. Sticking hard to the PRINCE2 will make managing bureaucratic and does not
 give any benefits. You should "tailor" the procedure to your needs.
